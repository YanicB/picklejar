                <h2>What is PickleJar?</h2>
                <p>
                    PickleJar is an anonymous idea-sharing and voting application
                    designed to help groups make unbiased decisions together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you're "in a pickle" and need to decide on something as a group,
                    PickleJar eliminates identity bias by keeping all ideas anonymous
                    during submission and voting.

                <h2>Why Anonymous?</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional brainstorming often favors ideas from louder voices or
                    higher-status individuals. PickleJar levels the playing field by
                    ensuring every idea is judged on its own merit, not on who suggested it.
