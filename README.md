# PickleJar
## Description
PickleJar is the LettuceMeet for ideas, an idea sharing and voting platform that lets users anonymously add and vote on ideas based on a theme. This is tailored for those who find it hard to make decisions in a group setting, this can range from planning hangouts with friends, to making decisions on projects. Ensuring a unanimous voting system, where there is no biase.
## The Problem 
Trying to make decisions as a group, can always be challenging. Especially, when there can be biases and differences of opinions. By making it anomymous, this removes any chances of favoritism, and ensuring that the vote is purely based on the ideas that were added.
